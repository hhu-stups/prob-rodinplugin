         ProB is an animator and model checker for the B-Method. It allows
fully automatic animation of many B specifications, and can be
used to systematically check a specification for errors. 
Part of the research and development was conducted within the
EPSRC funded projects ABCD and iMoc, and within the EU funded
project Rodin. 
Development is continued under the EU funded project Deploy and
the DFG project Gepavas. 
ProB has been successfully used on various industrial specifications
and is now being used within Siemens.
